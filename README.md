Ling 222 U20 project

This project is a collaboration between the participants in Linguistics 222 at UC Berkeley, Advanced Linguistic Typology. The participants are Madeline Bossi, Emily Drummond, Peter Jenks, Tessa Scott, and Samantha Walthugala.

This project is a modest extension of a project by Richard Futrell, Roger Levy, and Matthew Dryer. 

The R code in the project is theirs, and all of the coding for variables outside of the file Berkeley.csv is theirs as well; we have added a new way of coding the frequency distribution of U20 variables and modified the code to run poisson regression on those variables alongside the others.

The original project by Futrell, Levy, and Dryer is at: https://github.com/Futrell/nporder

The pre-published paper based on that project is at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02783
